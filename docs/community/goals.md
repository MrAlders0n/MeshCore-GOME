# Community Goals

This page is for all Ottawa Mesh community members, contributors, and newcomers who want to understand our growth objectives, strategic direction, and how to participate in shaping the future of the network.

Whether you are deploying hardware, experimenting with mesh networking, or simply learning about the project, these goals describe where we are heading and how we define success as a community.

## Community Expansion Goals

Our goal is to expand mesh networking across Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec while fostering technical learning, collaboration, and community resilience.

### Tangible Goals

- Increase the number of fixed repeater nodes in strategic locations
- Improve coverage density within Ottawa and surrounding rural areas
- Publish and maintain clear documentation for node deployment, best practices
- Reduce barriers for new contributors to deploy their first node

### Aspirational Goals

- Expand Quebec portion of mesh towards Wakefield, Montreal
- Westward mesh expansion towards Algonquin Park and Toronto
- A self sustaining community with shared responsibility for infrastructure and knowledge

## Defining Success

We define success through both technical performance and community engagement.

### Network Health

- Consistent growth in node count and geographic coverage
- Reliable routing and message delivery across regions
- Redundant paths that reduce single points of failure

### Community Health

- Active participation from a diverse group of contributors
- Regular knowledge sharing through documentation, discussions, and events
- Clear onboarding paths for newcomers with different skill levels

### Regional Impact

- Functional long range links connecting Ottawa to surrounding regions
- Strong relationships with neighboring mesh communities
- Demonstrated usefulness during events, experiments, and real world scenarios
