## Radio Compliance Rules

LoRa mesh networks operate mainly with unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) radio bands, which is regulated in Canada by [Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED)](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/devices-and-equipment/radio-equipment-standards/radio-standards-specifications-rss/rss-247-digital-transmission-systems-dtss-frequency-hopping-systems-fhss-and-licence-exempt-local).

1. All members agree to comply with Canadian regulations, in particular those governing conductive power for unlicensed low-power devices (limited to 1W input power) and antenna gain.

The maximum radiated output power for these unlicensed devices is **+30dBM / 1 Watt**. If you wish to use more power, you must be a licensed [amateur radio](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/radio-authorizations/amateur-radio-operator-certification) operator and must abide by all rules/regulations set by ISED for your amateur radio operator certificate.
