# Ottawa Coverage

!!! warning "NCR Coverage Page"
    This page is a work in progress. Coverage is based on real world reports from users running the MeshMapper app. The data will improve over time as more drives and walks are recorded.

MeshCore coverage in the NCR area is provided by mostly solar powered repeaters. Coverage can vary based on height, line of sight, and terrain, but the network generally reaches Ashton, Barrhaven, Buckingham, Carleton Place, Cumberland, Downtown, Kanata, Nepean, Old Ottawa South, Orleans, Richmond, and Stittsville.

For a live view of deployed nodes, check the [MeshCore Map](https://analyzer.letsme.sh/map?lat=45.4215&long=-75.6972&zoom=9).

## Live Coverage (MeshMapper)

The map below is powered by **MeshMapper**, a community-driven coverage tracking app created by **CSP-Tom** & **MrAlders0n**.  
MeshMapper gives us real world data points instead of simulations, letting us build an accurate picture of how the network actually performs across the region.
