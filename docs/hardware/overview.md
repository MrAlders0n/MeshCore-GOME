# Hardware (Start Here)

Welcome! This section helps you pick the right hardware for MeshCore, whether you’re just joining the mesh or you’re ready to help it grow.

## 1) Companions (Connect to the Mesh)
Start here to grab a companion and connect to the mesh:
- Recommended Companions (phones + handheld-friendly options)  
  -> [recommended-companions.md](recommended-companions.md)

These companions have been tried and tested by the Ottawa community and other meshes around the world. No need to reinvent the wheel, we have already done the testing.

!!! info
    REMEMBER TO GRAB A NEW ANTENNA, ALL OF THE ONES THAT COME WITH THE COMPANIONS HAVE BEEN RATED POORLY.  
    Recommended antennas are here: [recommended-antenna.md](recommended-antenna.md)

## 2) Repeaters (Expand coverage)
Repeaters are how we extend reach, fill dead zones, and make the network more reliable for everyone. Once you want to get started with helping the mesh expand or provide better coverage in your area, check out the recommended repeater hardware here:
- Recommended Repeaters (best coverage / best value picks)  
  -> [recommended-repeaters.md](recommended-repeaters.md)

These repeaters have been tried and tested by the Ottawa community and other meshes around the world. No need to reinvent the wheel, we have already done the testing.
