By building on LoRa, both systems enable decentralized, low-cost community networks.</p> <p>Most of the city is currently running MeshCore with some Meshtastic presence scattered around. We have roughly 50 static MeshCore repeaters around the region, linking Carleton Place, Ashton, Stittsville, Kemptville, Kanata, Barrhaven, Westboro, Downtown, Old Ottawa South, Vanier, Orl\u00e9ans, and areas near Cumberland.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in playing an active role in the community, we\u2019re always looking for volunteers.
